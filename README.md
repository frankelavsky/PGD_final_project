# PGD_final_project

take 2 (well, like take 7 to be honest) of getting this repo to work with unity lmao

## Notes

Clearly my biggest issue was that I should have moved my gitignore _into_ my project folder! Oof.

Also, as a note: this ist he first new repo and installation of VS Code where it has given me copilot by default. Disgusting!!! I can't press "control + i" to italicize text without disabling that demonic feature. How annoying.
