# PGD_final_project
This repo is a working, interactive prototype of a screen-reader accessible spell-building interface made in Unity 3D. [Design document for this project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C_QJr883xCOYB-PaV-upiVGqxSruFsfX0Jco_oc1GrQ/edit?usp=sharing).


## Notes
take 2 (well, like take 7 to be honest) of getting this repo to work with unity lmao

Clearly my biggest issue was that I should have moved my gitignore _into_ my project folder! Oof.

Also, as a note: this ist he first new repo and installation of VS Code where it has given me copilot by default. Disgusting!!! I can't press "control + i" to italicize text without disabling that demonic feature. How annoying.
